% This example shows how a triangular mesh can be resampled on a
% "meshgrid"-generated square grid. We illustrate the usage of
% both functions "gridtrimesh" and "mxgridtrimesh". These two should
% produce identical results. Funcion "mxgridtrimesh" is a compiled
% MEX function written in C and should execute quicker than
% "gridtrimesh".

% create a grid in x and y
x = linspace(min(V(:,1)),max(V(:,1)),nx);
y = linspace(min(V(:,2)),max(V(:,2)),ny);
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);

% find corresponding z-values by means of gridtrimesh.m

% find corresponding z-values by means of mxgridtrimesh.dll
% NOTE: the MEX file can be recompiled as follows:
%    mex -setup           % choose appropriate C compiler
%    mex mxgridtrimesh.c  % compile the file
fprintf('mxgridtrimesh.....'); tic
