This file contains information about the MeshLP code which computes the Mesh
Laplace operator based on the paper "Discrete Laplace Operator on Meshed
Surfaces", Mikhail Belkin, Jian Sun and Yusu Wang, SoCG 2008.  The code is
written by jian sun.  

The source code as well as the binary code is distributed for Linux. 
The source code is ready to be compiled on other platform though it
is not tested. 

DESCRIPTION
	The MeshLP program reads an input off file that contains a triangle mesh
	and compute the mesh laplace matrix. The program is written in C++, see
	meshlpmatrix.h for the routines that compute the laplace matrix. 
	It also provides matlab interface: symmshlp_matrix.m, which has self contained 
	desription. eigens_msh.m gives an example on computing the eigenfunctions 
	and eigenvalues of the laplace operator.
