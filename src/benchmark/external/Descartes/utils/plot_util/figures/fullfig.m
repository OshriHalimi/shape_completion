function [ h ] = fullfig(varargin)
%FULLFIG creates a full-screen figure.

%% Syntax
%
% fullfig
% fullfig('PropertyName',propertyvalue,...)
% fullfig(h)
% fullfig(...,'Border',BorderPercentage)
% h = fullfig(...)
%
%% Description
%
% fullfig creates a new full-screen graphics figure.  This automatically becomes the
% the current figure and raises it above all other figures on the screen until a
% new figure is either created or called.
%
% fullfig('PropertyName',propertyvalue,...) creates a new figure object using the values
% of the properties specified. For a description of the properties, see Figure Properties.
% MATLAB uses default values for any properties that you do not explicitly define as arguments.
%
% fullfig(h) does one of two things, depending on whether or not a figure with handle h
% exists. If h is the handle to an existing figure, fullfig(h) makes the figure identified
% by h the current figure, makes it visible, makes it full-screen, applies a Border if a Border
% is specified, and raises the figure above all other figures on the screen. The current
% figure is the target for graphics output. If h is not the handle to an existing figure, but
% is an integer, fullfig(h) creates a figure and assigns it the handle h. fullfig(h) where h
% is not the handle to a figure, and is not an integer, is an error.
%
% fullfig(...,'Border',BorderPercentage) creates a Border between the perimeter of the figure
% and the perimeter of your screen. BorderPercentage must be in the range of 0 to 50, and can
% be a scalar value to apply the same percentage value to the width and height of the figure,
% or a two-element vector to apply different Borders in the x- and y- directions, respectively.
%
% h = fullfig(...) returns the handle to the figure object.
