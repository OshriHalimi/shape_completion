function Z = mesh2surf(F,V,X,Y)
%GRIDTRIMESH Fitting a square grid onto a triangular mesh.
%
%   Z = GRIDTRIMESH(F,V,X,Y) fits a surface of the form Z = F(X,Y) to the
%   triangular mesh defined by F and V.
%   
%   The triangles of the triangular mesh are defined in the m-by-3 face
%   matrix F. Each row of F defines a single triangular face by indexing
%   into the n-by-3 matrix V that contains X, Y and Z coordinates of the
%   vertices.
%
%   It is assumed that X and Y are produced by [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y),
%   where x and y are monotonically increasing vectors.
%
%   The function Z = MXGRIDTRIMESH(F,V,X,Y) gives exactly the same result
%   but is coded in C and compiled using MEX resulting in slightly faster
%   execution.
%
%   Example: (assume the file example.mat contains F and V)
%        load example
%        nx = 10; ny = 10;
%        x = linspace(min(V(:,1)),max(V(:,1)),nx);
%        y = linspace(min(V(:,2)),max(V(:,2)),ny);
%        [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);
%        Z = gridtrimesh(F,V,X,Y);
%        surf(X,Y,Z)
